# Data Science Portfolio ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Satyaki. I have a background in mechanical engineering and experience handling datasets, building dashboards and end to end ml pipelines in the feild of predictive maintenance. I have worked for an automotive company for about 4 years where I my responsibilities were to build simulations for EV batteries, build dashboards for sensor data and build and maintain predictive models for failure detection for the EV batteries. Currently pursuing my Msc in Data and Business analytics

## Projects



[**Becoming a data professional -- insights from kaggle's 2020 DS survey**](https://github.com/Satyaki9207/how-to-become-a-data-professional)  
There are so many resources on the internet for learning Data science and well as a vast number of machine learning techniques from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning based methods. It may be very confusing for someone trying to break into the field to get a grasp of exactly what to learn. Since I'm trying to break into the field myself, I decided to explore Kaggle's 2020 data science survey. It consists of about 20,000 responses, both from students and professionals about their age, education ,job roles and large variety of other profession related topics.In this analysis, I tried looking at the professionals and data science practices of companies, both large and small and try to find patterns in professionals within a job role and across job roles

[**Predicting credit Default**](https://github.com/Satyaki9207/Loan_default_prediction)  
A bank is interested in predicting which customers are likely to default on loans in advance.It can adjust customer's credit worthiness criteria accordingly and avoid giving out bad loans. It has collected data like credit utilization,age,past delinquency,debt ratio,income etc related to the customer.  

**Keywords** Binary classification, imbalanced classes, xgboost, neural network


[**Predicting Employee Attrition**](https://github.com/Satyaki9207/kaggle_HR_analytics/tree/master)
A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who successfully complete some courses conducted by the company. Many people signup for their training. They want to know which of these candidates really want to work for the company after training or look for new employment. They are interested in reducing the cost and time for planning the courses and categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience are collected from the candidates at the time of enrollment<br/>
